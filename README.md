This machine learning project uses python to develop Employees Attrition prediction model to aid the hospital  to determine most significant factors influencing customer retention to optimize better business strategies.  

Employees Attrition Prediction Using Machine Learning Model
I developed a predictive model to forecast customer churn in a telco dataset using supervised learning techniques. The project aimed to identify the most significant factors influencing Hospital Employees Atrrition and optimize business strategies.

## Process:
▪Data Preparation: Cleaned and preprocessed the data, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.  
▪Model Building: Implemented a classification algorithm logistic regression achieving 77% accuracy.  
▪Evaluation: Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score matrics.   

## Key Insights: 
Contract length and customer service satisfaction were crucial predictors of churn. The model provided valuable insights for retention strategies.  
## Tools: 
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Machine Learning Algorithms.  
This project showcases my ability to apply machine-learning techniques to real-world problems. Code snippets and visualizations are available in my portfolio.
